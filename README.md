# What is this?
Derived from the nethunter kernel for the oneplus x, updated to latest spec

# How it was made + How to replicate
I followed the build instructions for cyanogemod to get the kernel sources
(link: https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Doc:_porting_intro)
After, I applied the patches for HID and MAC80211 support end went through the configuration with make menuconfig and changed it to the nethunter defaults.

Works flawlessly.
